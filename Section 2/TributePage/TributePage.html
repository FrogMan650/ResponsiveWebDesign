        <p id="tribute-info">The Lone Wanderer achieved some amazing things in the capital wasteland:</p>
        <p class="tribute-story">For 19 years, the Lone Wanderer lived in Vault 101 without incident, but in 2277, their father James disappeared without any explanation.  To find him the Lone Wanderer left Vault 101 and traveled all over the wasteland that once was Washington D.C., following in the footsteps of their father.</p>
        <p class="tribute-story">Once the Lone Wanderer eventually found their father in Vault 112, they returned to the Jefferson Memorial where Project Purity was taking place. Which was an effort to provide purified drinking water for the entire wasteland.  Unfortunately while they were there the Enclave attacked the memorial and seized control of project Purity.  James tried to stop them by sacrificing himself, but it didn't work and the Lone Wanderer had to evacuate the memorial.</p>
         <p class="tribute-story">With the help of the Brotherhood of Steel and a friendly super mutant Fawkes the Lone Wanderer was able to retrieve the G.E.C.K from Vault 87.  Which was integrel to repairing Project Purity to a working state.  However, the Lone Wanderer was captured by the Enclave shortly after retrieving the G.E.C.K.  But the Lone Wanderer managed to escape and make it back to the Brotherhood of Steel to mount their attack on the Jefferson memorial with their secret weapon, Liberty Prime.  Which was a massive combat robot built by the Brotherhood.</p>
         <p class="tribute-story">Once the Enclave was defeated and the purifier had been fixed, they were faced with a choice.  When James sacrificed himself in an attempt to save the purifier from the Enclave he flooded the control chamber with deadly radiation, killing himself in the process.  Now the Lone Wanderer had a choice.  They could either sacrifice themselves by going in the chamber to activate the purifier for the better of all inhabitants of the capital wasteland, or they could let someone else do it. Selflessly the Lone Wanderer entered the control room and activated the purifier, enabling purified water for everyone in the capital wasteland.</p>
         <p class="tribute-story">A true hero, the Lone Wanderer achieved far more than is depicted here.  On their quest to find and help their father they helped countless people all across the wasteland.  From saving an entire city from a "dorment" nuke, to helping someone write a wasteland survival guide.</p>
