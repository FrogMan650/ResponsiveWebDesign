These are all of the course projects for the Responsive Web Design Certificate from freeCodeCamp.

Each Section generally has 2-4 learning projects where you're shown how to use elements and css rules and 1 project where you're given a blank slate and given some requirements for that project.

Each Section will have a README detailing the final section project.
